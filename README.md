#Pebble_HourGlass is a watchface for the Pebble smartwatch.

It is a demo on programming a simulation using a similar technique as used in the context of cellular automata.
Feel free to use this as example or suggestion for your own Pebble project.

The watchface also include a day-night-switch which changes the foreground and background colour of the application.
